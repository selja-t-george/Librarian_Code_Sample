# Librarian_Code_Sample

This code sample illustrates/models the working of a library.
It supports the following interactions:
1. Lookup : Search the details of a book in the library.
2. Add: Add a copy of a book in the catalogue.
3. Borrow: Borrow a book from the library if atleast one copy is available.
4. Return: Return a borrowed book. Here, it is assumed that a book is not returned if it is not borrowed (If return operations are performed more times than previous borrow operations, available number will be more than number of copies. According to the assumption made, this is an unlikely use case).
5. Stock : Check the stock of all books in the catalogue.

The interaction with the library can performed by modifying the script() block in the beginning of librarian.js
